# Challenge-2
# # My Portfolio

In this challenge I developed my own website, through this website I created a portfolio for future employers to get to know me and get a visual representaion of my work. In my portfolio website I added a header with an image of myself, my name and four links, an about me, work, contact, and resume. All these links will direct you to the section of the website where they are located. I also addded images to the about me and work sections, as well as my contact information in the contact section and a clickable link in the resume section that will take you to my resume. In addition I added hover elements to the website so the sections background and boarder will change when the mouse hovers over them. At the end of the webpage I added a footer with the text "Thanks for taking the time to view my Website"
