    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is [Your Name], and I am a bit of an outdoor enthusiast turned tech enthusiast. For the past decade, I have worked in the outdoor industry, spending my winters as a ski patroller at the renowned Park City Mountain Resort and my summers as a mountain guide, most recently on the towering heights of Mt. Rainier.

While my outdoor adventures have been thrilling and rewarding, I've always been curious about other fields and wanted to explore new opportunities. That's why I've recently made the jump to the tech industry! Currently, I am working as an EMT in the emergency department at the University of Utah, while also exploring the exciting world of coding.

I have always been fascinated by the potential of technology to change the world, and I'm excited to be a part of it. As a beginner in coding, I am eager to learn everything I can and to apply my problem-solving skills in new and exciting ways. Though coding is a completely new skill for me, I'm excited about the challenge and look forward to exploring this fascinating field.

My diverse background has taught me the importance of adaptability, grit, and passion, and I believe that these traits will help me to succeed in my new career path. Whether I'm navigating through rugged mountain terrain or solving complex coding challenges, I always approach challenges with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn.

So, that's a bit about me! I am thrilled to be embarking on this new adventure and excited to see where it takes me. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
