                Hi there! I'm an outdoor enthusiast with a passion for adventure and exploration. Whether I'm outside
                rock climbing, carving down powdery slopes, or pounding out miles on a trail run, I love to challenge
                myself and push my limits.

                For the past decade, I've been fully immersed in the outdoor industry. In the winter months, I worked as
                a ski patroller at Park City Mountain Resort, keeping thousands of skiers safe and responding to any
                emergencies that arose. Come summer, I transitioned into guiding, leading groups of intrepid adventurers
                up the iconic and including the formidable Mt. Rainier.

                Despite my love for the outdoors, I recently decided to shift gears and explore a new path. I'm
                currently working as an EMT in the emergency department at the University of Utah, where I'm constantly
                learning and growing as a medical professional.

                But my thirst for knowledge doesn't stop there. In my spare time, I've taken up coding and am absolutely
                thrilled to be diving headfirst into this fascinating and ever-evolving field. It's a completely new
                challenge for me, but one that I'm eager to tackle with enthusiasm and determination.

                When I'm not coding or working in the emergency department, you can find me behind the lens of my
                camera, capturing the beauty of the natural world around me. I also love to cook and garden, constantly
                experimenting with new recipes and nurturing my green thumb.

                Overall, I'm a lifelong learner and adventurer, always seeking new experiences and challenges. I can't
                wait to see where this journey takes me next!
            </p>

                Although I am new to coding and currently don't have any projects to showcase, I am brimming with excitement and enthusiasm for the future. As I continue to learn and grow my coding skills, I am confident that I will be able to develop innovative and creative projects that will make a meaningful impact. I am excited about the endless possibilities that coding offers, and I am determined to use my newfound knowledge to create projects that not only showcase my skills but also benefit society. With each new line of code, I am one step closer to realizing my dreams, and I am excited to see what the future holds. The sky's the limit, and I am ready to take on the challenge.
