            Hi there! I'm an outdoor enthusiast with a passion for adventure and exploration. Whether it's scaling rock faces, carving down powdery slopes, or pounding out miles on a trail run, I love to challenge myself and push my limits.

            For the past decade, I've been fully immersed in the outdoor industry. In the winter months, I worked as a ski patroller at Park City Mountain Resort, keeping thousands of skiers safe and responding to any emergencies that arose. Come summer, I transitioned into guiding, leading groups of intrepid adventurers up some of the most iconic peaks in the country, including the formidable Mt. Rainier.
            
            Despite my love for the outdoors, I recently decided to shift gears and explore a new path. I'm currently working as an EMT in the emergency department at the University of Utah, where I'm constantly learning and growing as a medical professional.
            
            But my thirst for knowledge doesn't stop there. In my spare time, I've taken up coding and am absolutely thrilled to be diving headfirst into this fascinating and ever-evolving field. It's a completely new challenge for me, but one that I'm eager to tackle with enthusiasm and determination.
            
            When I'm not coding or working in the emergency department, you can find me behind the lens of my camera, capturing the beauty of the natural world around me. I'm also an avid home cook and gardener, constantly experimenting with new recipes and nurturing my green thumb.
            
            Overall, I'm a lifelong learner and adventurer, always seeking new experiences and challenges. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next!
